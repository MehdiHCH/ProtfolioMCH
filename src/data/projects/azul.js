  overview: `System Architecture: Handwritten Image → Preprocessing (Otsu Thresholding) → Parallel Recognition Engines (CNN / Tesseract / PaddleOCR) → Prediction Fusion → Multi-format Export. Key Contributions: Built custom 6-layer CNN achieving 94.2% character accuracy. Fine-tuned Tesseract OCR on AMHCD dataset for Amazigh optimization. Adapted PaddleOCR for word/line recognition. Implemented hybrid fusion combining 3 independent approaches achieving 91.2% sentence accuracy. Developed augmentation pipeline (×5 expansion) and validated with 50+ users. First open-source Tifinagh OCR solution in Morocco, preserving Amazigh cultural heritage through AI.`,
