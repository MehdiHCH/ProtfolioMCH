    keyContributions: [
      "Built a custom 6-layer CNN from scratch, trained on all 33 Tifinagh characters, achieving 94.2% character-level recognition accuracy.",
      "Fine-tuned Tesseract OCR on the AMHCD (Amazigh Handwritten Character Dataset) in collaboration with IRCAM, optimizing it specifically for Amazigh word-level recognition.",
      "Adapted PaddleOCR with multi-scale detection for robust full-line and sentence-level Tifinagh recognition, reaching 91.2% sentence accuracy.",
      "Engineered a data augmentation pipeline (rotation, translation, zoom) that expanded the training dataset fivefold, compensating for the scarcity of annotated Amazigh data.",
      "Designed and implemented a hybrid prediction fusion mechanism combining outputs from all three engines, consistently outperforming any single-model approach.",
      "Delivered the first open-source Tifinagh OCR solution in Morocco, validated with 50+ real users and supporting PNG, JPG, and JPEG input formats.",
